Normal form or diverge

Determine if each of the following can be reduced to a ormal form of if they diverge:

1.  \x.xxx          // is in normal form
                    // nothing to apply to
2.  (\z.zz)(\y.yy)
    (\y.yy)(\y.yy)
    (...)           // diverges

3.  (\x.xxx)z
    zzz             // is in normal form
